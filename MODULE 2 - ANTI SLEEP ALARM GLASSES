20EC5203 ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT-I
MODULE 2 - ANTI SLEEP ALARM GLASSES

<ABSTRACT>

Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents worldwide, often resulting from long hours of driving and lack of rest. Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses address this issue by using sensors and algorithms to detect 
early signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eyelid closures or head tilting. Upon detection, they activate an auditory or vibrational alarm to alert the user and prevent accidents. Designed for comfort, 
these glasses are ideal for long-distance drivers and night shift workers. This innovation improves road safety, reduces accidents, and highlights potential for future advancements in fatigue detection technology.

<INTRODUCTION>

The Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses is an innovative wearable device designed to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness, particularly among drivers and individuals engaged in critical tasks. The glasses are equipped
with infrared (IR) sensors to monitor the user's eye movements and detect early signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eyelid closure or reduced blinking rates. When the device identifies these signs, it triggers
an immediate alert in the form of a buzzer or vibration, effectively waking the user and preventing potential mishaps. The compact, lightweight design ensures comfort during prolonged use, making it suitable for
drivers, machine operators, and other professionals prone to fatigue. This project combines sensor technology with real-time monitoring to address a significant safety issue. By providing an early warning system,
the Anti-Sleep Alarm Glasses offers a practical and efficient solution to reduce accidents, improve safety, and save lives.
